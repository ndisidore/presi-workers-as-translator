# The Babel Fix: Unifying APIs with Cloudflare Workers and AI

A comprehensive presentation about solving API integration challenges using modern edge computing and AI translation techniques. This talk demonstrates how Cloudflare Workers can serve as universal API adapters, eliminating the complexity of managing multiple API integrations in your applications.

## 📖 Presentation Overview

**"The Babel Fix"** tells the story of API integration evolution through five acts:

- **Opening Hook**: The $47 million typo and the true cost of API integration failures
- **Act I - Adapters**: Traditional in-application adapter patterns and their limitations
- **Act II - Single Worker**: Moving API adaptation to the edge with Cloudflare Workers
- **Act III - Dynamic Dispatcher**: Building intelligent routing and transformation layers
- **Act IV - Workflows**: Orchestrating complex multi-API interactions with Durable Objects
- **Act V - AI Translation**: Using AI to automatically translate between API schemas and formats

The presentation uses real-world examples from companies like Cloudflare, showing concrete technical solutions with live code demonstrations and architectural diagrams.

## 🚀 Technology Stack

- **[Slidev](https://sli.dev/)** - Modern presentation framework for developers
- **[Cloudflare Workers](https://workers.cloudflare.com/)** - Edge deployment platform
- **[Workers Assets](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/static-assets/)** - Static asset serving
- **[D2](https://d2lang.com/)** - Technical diagram rendering with custom Slidev addon
- **TypeScript** - Type-safe development experience
- **Vue 3** - Component framework for interactive elements

## 🛠️ Local Development

### Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start Slidev development server
npm run dev
```

The presentation will be available at <http://localhost:3030> with hot-reload enabled for rapid development.

### Testing Workers Deployment Locally

To test the full Cloudflare Workers deployment experience:

```bash
# Build the Slidev presentation
npm run build

# Start local Workers development server
npm run wrangler:dev
```

This simulates the production environment locally, serving the built presentation through Workers Assets.

### Production Deployment

Deploy to Cloudflare Workers:

```bash
npm run wrangler:deploy
```

### Modular Slide Organization

This presentation follows a modular approach with individual slide files imported into the main `slides.md`. This structure makes it easier to:

- Edit specific sections without scrolling through a large file
- Collaborate on different parts of the presentation
- Reuse sections across different talks
- Maintain clean version control history

## 📊 Advanced Features

### D2 Technical Diagrams

The presentation includes a custom D2 addon for creating beautiful technical diagrams. Use the `<D2Diagram>` component in your slides:

```vue
<script setup>
const apiFlow = `
client: {
  shape: hexagon
  style: {fill: '#4A90E2'}
}
worker: {
  shape: rectangle
  label: 'Cloudflare Worker'
  style: {fill: '#F5A623'}
}
api1: {label: 'Legacy API'}
api2: {label: 'Modern API'}

client -> worker: Request
worker -> api1: Translate & Forward
worker -> api2: Route Based on Rules
api1 -> worker: Response
worker -> client: Unified Format
`
</script>

<D2Diagram
  :code="apiFlow"
  :scale="0.8"
  max-height="400px"
/>
```

**Available D2Diagram Props:**
- `code` (required) - D2 diagram syntax
- `theme` - D2 theme (default: 'default')
- `sketch` - Enable sketch mode (default: false)
- `scale` - Scale factor (default: 1)
- `width` / `height` - Fixed dimensions
- `maxWidth` / `maxHeight` - Maximum dimensions

### Interactive Code Examples

The presentation includes interactive code snippets with syntax highlighting and step-by-step reveals using Slidev's click animations.

### Responsive Design

All slides are optimized for various screen sizes and presentation formats, from large conference screens to laptop presentations.
