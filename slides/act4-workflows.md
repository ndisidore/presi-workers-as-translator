<!-- speaker:
"Here's the code. And I want you to notice what's NOT in this code."
"Step 1: Enrich the data. 5 retries, 5 second delay, exponential backoff."
"Step 2: Send to external API. 5 retries, 5 second delay, exponential backoff."
"Now here's what's not here: No database calls to persist state. No Redis to track progress. No 'save checkpoint' logic."
"The step.do() call? That's it. That's the whole magic."
"If Step 1 fails, it retries. If it succeeds, that result is persisted automatically. Step 2 never re-runs Step 1."
"If your whole Worker gets redeployed mid-execution? Doesn't matter. The state is in Cloudflare's durable storage."
"If Salesforce is down for 6 hours? The workflow sleeps. Doesn't cost you anything. Wakes up when it's time to retry."
Pause: "You wrote 'await step.do()' and got Netflix-grade orchestration."

<!-- speaker:
"Why Cloudflare Workflows? I know what some of you are thinking: 'This sounds like Temporal or AWS Step Functions.'"
"And you're absolutely right. They share a similar durable execution model. And that's a compliment! Temporal and Step Functions are battle-tested, production-grade tools."
"This isn't a 'versus' conversation. It's a 'when' conversation."
"Temporal is excellent for orchestrating long-running backend processes‚Äîmulti-day workflows coordinating dozens of microservices. Step Functions shine for serverless workflows in AWS ecosystems."
"Cloudflare Workflows excel at a specific use case: edge-native API integrations."
Point to the right column: "Edge-native means your workflow runs in the same 300+ cities where your Workers already run. No separate orchestration layer in a different region."
"Sub-millisecond cold starts because you're already at the edge. No container spin-up time."
"Tight integration‚Äîone platform. You're not stitching together Workers + a separate orchestration service. It's all Cloudflare."
"Cost model optimized for what we're doing: high-volume, short-lived integration tasks. Temporal's pricing makes sense for long-running workflows. This is purpose-built for API glue."
"And zero ops. You're not managing Temporal clusters or configuring Step Functions state machines across regions."
Pause: "Use the right tool for the job. If you're orchestrating complex backend processes, Temporal is phenomenal. If you're building edge-native API integrations? This is your tool."
Tone: Respectful of alternatives, confident in the use case fit.
Transition: "Alright, let me show you what this actually looks like in a timeline..."

"Your integration can literally sleep for days and wake up exactly where it left off."
"I need you to understand how insane this is."
Point to the diagram: "Step 1 hits rate limit. Sleeps 5 seconds. Wakes up, retries, succeeds."
"Step 2 hits service down. Sleeps 6 hours. Not 'holds a connection'. Not 'burns CPU'. Sleeps."
"The workflow doesn't exist during those 6 hours. No memory. No CPU. No cost."
"6 hours later: wakes up, retries, succeeds."
"The magic: state is persisted automatically. The workflow is reconstructed from durable storage when it's time to wake up."

<!-- speaker:
"This is like having a backup plan for your backup plan's backup plan."
"Each step can fail and recover independently. Step 1's retry strategy can be different from Step 2's."
"Step 1 might retry every 5 seconds. Step 2 might retry every hour."
"They don't care about each other. They're composed, but isolated."
"And here's the kicker: this works for workflows that run for DAYS. Weeks even."
"I've seen workflows that orchestrate month-long business processes. They just... sleep. And wake up when they need to."
"And for the ops team that gets paged at 3am when integrations break? This is your peace of mind. Workflows don't need you to babysit them. They don't need you to manually restart failed jobs or clear stuck queues. They self-heal. You sleep."
Tone: This is the power of true durable execution, with real operational benefits.
