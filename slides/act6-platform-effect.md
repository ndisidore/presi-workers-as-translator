<!-- speaker:
"The Grand Unification — putting it all together. This is where all six acts converge into one coherent system."
Walk through the pipeline slowly: "Top path: API docs and OpenAPI specs go into the AI model, which generates adapter code. Bottom path: Bring-your-own adapter if you already have custom logic."
"Both paths converge at the Worker Translator. Doesn't matter if the adapter came from AI or from your engineering team — it gets the same treatment."
"Worker feeds the Workflow Orchestrator — remember, the one that can sleep for days and wake up exactly where it left off."
"Workflow sends real-time updates to your customer app, which sees one beautiful, unified schema."
Pause: "Two paths converge. AI-generated or bring-your-own. Both get edge deployment, both get workflows, both get platform benefits."
"This is the power of platform thinking. You're not building features — you're building an ecosystem where the pieces compose."
Tone: This is the synthesis moment. Everything comes together.
Transition: "But it gets even better when you add community effects..."

"The Integration Marketplace. This is where platforms become ecosystems."
Left side: "Imagine npm, but for API integrations. Filterable by source and target — 'show me all Stripe to Slack adapters.' Sortable by popularity and reliability. Ratings and reviews from the community."
"Template tags: is this a complete integration or just a base class you extend? Does it work with Workflows? Is it AI-enhanced?"
"The workflow: Browse. Fork. Customize. Deploy. Same as any other open source package."
Right side: "Extensible patterns — this is where it gets interesting."
Point to the first code block: "Extend a popular base class. Someone already wrote a solid Slack adapter. You inherit it, add your company-specific logic — priority calculation, CRM enrichment — done."
Second block: "Or mix and match capabilities like Lego blocks. SlackTransformer + NotionPublisher + RetryMixin. Compose the integration from tested, battle-hardened pieces."
Third block: "Popular templates: webhook-to-database, chat-to-ticketing, payment-notifications. The patterns that everyone needs."
Pause: "Community code + custom business logic = love."
"This isn't just 'code sharing.' This is network effects. The more adapters in the marketplace, the less work everyone has to do. Every new integration makes the platform more valuable for everyone."
Tone: This is the vision of a thriving ecosystem.
Transition: "Let me paint you the full vision..."

# **The Vision** 🚀

<div class="p-6 bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-100 to-purple-100 dark:from-blue-900 dark:to-purple-900 rounded-lg m-8 mt-16">

"A world where API integration is as easy as adding a dependency"
</div>

```bash
# The future of API integration
npm install @acme-app/stripe-adapter
npm install @acme-app/slack-adapter
npm install @acme-app/salesforce-adapter

# Just works™️
```

</div>

<!-- speaker:
"The Vision: A world where API integration is as easy as adding a dependency."
Read the commands slowly: "npm install @acme-app/stripe-adapter. npm install @acme-app/slack-adapter. npm install @acme-app/salesforce-adapter."
Pause: "And it just works."
"No reading documentation. No writing transformation code. No debugging edge cases. No Kafka clusters to maintain."
"Just... works."
"Think about what this means for a startup. Day one, you need to integrate with Stripe. You npm install an adapter. Day two, customer asks for Slack notifications. npm install. Day three, they want Salesforce sync. npm install."
"You spent zero engineering time on integrations. You spent it on your actual product. The thing that makes you different."
"This is the vision. Not 'integrations are faster.' Not 'integrations are cheaper.' Integrations disappear as a concern."
Let that vision land. Let the audience imagine it.
Tone: Inspiring, but grounded in practical benefit.
Transition: "And there's one more piece that makes this all powerful — shared state..."

# Level Up: Shared State Across Workflows

```sql
-- Store Integration responses for reuse

  id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  customer_id TEXT,
  source_api TEXT,
  resource_id TEXT,
  response_data JSON,
  created_at TIMESTAMP,
  expires_at TIMESTAMP
);

-- Fetch cached user data in next run/chain
SELECT response_data
FROM integration_responses
WHERE customer_id = ?
  AND source_api = 'slack'
  AND resource_id = 'user_12345'

<!-- speaker:
"Level Up: Shared State Across Workflows. This is where the platform becomes intelligent."
Point to the SQL schema: "Store integration responses for reuse. You called Slack's user API to fetch Alice's profile? Cache it. Next workflow that needs Alice's data? Instant retrieval. No redundant API calls."
"This isn't just caching. It's building institutional memory."
Right side: "User Context built by all workflows. Every time any integration touches a user, it enriches the shared knowledge base."
"Business Rules — the platform learns patterns. 'Alice from Engineering always wants critical alerts in #ops, not #engineering.' That's stored. Applied automatically."
"Integration Checkpoints — resume anywhere. Workflow A fetched Stripe data. Workflow B can pick up exactly where A left off."
"Cross-Workflow Events — trigger chains. Stripe payment succeeds → send Slack notification → create Salesforce lead → all choreographed, all durable."
Pause on the magic: "Each workflow enriches the platform for all others. Your integration layer has institutional memory."
"This is the difference between a tool and a platform. A tool runs code. A platform learns, remembers, and gets smarter over time."
Tone: This is sophisticated infrastructure made simple.
Transition: "But what about non-technical users? Can they benefit too?"

"The No-Code Bridge. Because not everyone wants to write code. And that's okay."
Left: "Visual field mapper. Drag Slack's 'user' field to Notion's 'created_by'. Drag 'text' to 'title'. Drag 'channel' to 'workspace'."
"Add transforms visually: prefix title with '[ALERT]'. Add validation: require non-empty title. Add enrichment: look up user in CRM."
"This is Zapier-level simplicity. But with platform-level power."
Right: "Progressive complexity — this is the secret sauce."
"Level 1: You're a product manager. Drag and drop. No code. Build an integration in 5 minutes."
"Level 2: You're a power user. Add simple transforms — prefix, format, filter. Still no code."
"Level 3: You're developer-adjacent. Insert custom JavaScript snippets for complex logic. Little code."
"Level 4: You're an engineer. Export to full Worker code. Complete control."
Pause: "One interface. Four levels of expertise. Everyone gets exactly the abstraction they need."
"And here's the beautiful part: the visual mapper generates Worker code behind the scenes. Level 1 user builds an integration visually? It deploys as a real Worker. Same infrastructure as the engineers use."
"No separate 'no-code runtime.' No performance penalty. No feature limitations. The no-code tool is just a different UI for the same powerful platform."
Tone: Inclusivity and practical design.
