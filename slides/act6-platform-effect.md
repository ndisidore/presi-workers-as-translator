<!-- speaker:
"The Grand Unification ‚Äî putting it all together. This is where all six acts converge into one coherent system."
Walk through the pipeline slowly: "Top path: API docs and OpenAPI specs go into the AI model, which generates adapter code. Bottom path: Bring-your-own adapter if you already have custom logic."
"Both paths converge at the Worker Translator. Doesn't matter if the adapter came from AI or from your engineering team ‚Äî it gets the same treatment."
"Worker feeds the Workflow Orchestrator ‚Äî remember, the one that can sleep for days and wake up exactly where it left off."
"Workflow sends real-time updates to your customer app, which sees one beautiful, unified schema."
Pause: "Two paths converge. AI-generated or bring-your-own. Both get edge deployment, both get workflows, both get platform benefits."
"This is the power of platform thinking. You're not building features ‚Äî you're building an ecosystem where the pieces compose."
"And different roles see different value here:"
"Business leaders‚Äîthis is how you turn technical debt into technical leverage. Every adapter you build makes the next one easier. The platform compounds value over time."
"Architects‚Äîthis is composable infrastructure that scales horizontally without operational overhead. Add a new customer? No new infrastructure. Add a new API? No architectural changes."
"Developers‚Äîyou're writing business logic, not plumbing. The interesting problems. The stuff that makes your product unique."
Tone: This is the synthesis moment. Everything comes together for everyone.
Transition: "Let's take a step back and realize what you've actually built..."

<!-- speaker:
"Let's pause and realize what you've actually built here."
"You started with a simple problem: 'I need to integrate with Slack.' Then it was Teams. Then Salesforce. Then 297 more."
"But look at what you have now..."
Walk through each box: "Infrastructure that can handle ANY adapter‚ÄîREST, SOAP, GraphQL, webhooks, all of them. Workers at the edge translating everything."
"Reliability for long-running processes. Workflows that can sleep for days and self-heal. Your integrations survive Salesforce outages."
"AI generation at scale. New adapter? Paste the docs, get working code in seconds. Not weeks."
"Multi-tenant isolation. Each customer gets their own sandbox. No cross-contamination. No shared state bugs."
Pause on the realization: "You didn't build AN integration. You built an INTEGRATION PLATFORM."
"And platforms have a fundamentally different property than tools: they have network effects."
"The more adapters in your platform, the more valuable it becomes. Not just for you‚Äîfor everyone who uses it."
"This is the mindset shift. You're not in the integration business anymore. You're in the platform business."
Tone: This is the 'aha' moment where tool becomes platform.

"The Integration Marketplace. This is where platforms become ecosystems."
Left side: "Imagine npm, but for API integrations. Filterable by source and target ‚Äî 'show me all Stripe to Slack adapters.' Sortable by popularity and reliability. Ratings and reviews from the community."
"Template tags: is this a complete integration or just a base class you extend? Does it work with Workflows? Is it AI-enhanced?"

<!-- speaker:
"The Vision: A world where API integration is as easy as adding a dependency."
Read the commands slowly: "npm install @acme-app/stripe-adapter. npm install @acme-app/slack-adapter. npm install @acme-app/salesforce-adapter."
Pause: "And it just works."
"No reading documentation. No writing transformation code. No debugging edge cases. No Kafka clusters to maintain."
"Just... works."
"Think about what this means for a startup. Day one, you need to integrate with Stripe. You npm install an adapter. Day two, customer asks for Slack notifications. npm install. Day three, they want Salesforce sync. npm install."
"You spent zero engineering time on integrations. You spent it on your actual product. The thing that makes you different."
"This is the vision. Not 'integrations are faster.' Not 'integrations are cheaper.' Integrations disappear as a concern."
Let that vision land. Let the audience imagine it.
Tone: Inspiring, but grounded in practical benefit.

"Level Up: Shared State Across Workflows. This is where the platform becomes intelligent."
Point to the SQL schema: "Store integration responses for reuse. You called Slack's user API to fetch Alice's profile? Cache it. Next workflow that needs Alice's data? Instant retrieval. No redundant API calls."
"This isn't just caching. It's building institutional memory."
Right side: "User Context built by all workflows. Every time any integration touches a user, it enriches the shared knowledge base."
"Business Rules ‚Äî the platform learns patterns. 'Alice from Engineering always wants critical alerts in #ops, not #engineering.' That's stored. Applied automatically."
"Integration Checkpoints ‚Äî resume anywhere. Workflow A fetched Stripe data. Workflow B can pick up exactly where A left off."
"Cross-Workflow Events ‚Äî trigger chains. Stripe payment succeeds ‚Üí send Slack notification ‚Üí create Salesforce lead ‚Üí all choreographed, all durable."
Pause on the magic: "Each workflow enriches the platform for all others. Your integration layer has institutional memory."
"This is the difference between a tool and a platform. A tool runs code. A platform learns, remembers, and gets smarter over time."
Tone: This is sophisticated infrastructure made simple.
Transition: "But what about non-technical users? Can they benefit too?"
