# The £330M API Meltdown

<tabler-alert-triangle class="text-6xl mb-8" />

**A single API contract change that broke an entire bank**

<v-click>

*"In 2018, TSB Bank pushed a system migration that broke API compatibility overnight — locking millions of customers out of their accounts and costing over £330 million."*

</v-click>

<div class="absolute inset-0 bg-red-500/25 animate-pulse"></div>

<!-- speaker:
“This… is the £330 million API meltdown.”
TSB Bank’s system migration in 2018 — they merged two backend systems, and an API schema mismatch brought the whole operation to its knees.
Customers were locked out for weeks, and the cost ballooned into the hundreds of millions.
Tone: a single mismatch in data contracts can cascade across an entire enterprise.
Transition: “But it’s not just banks…”

# The $1.1T Rally Outage

<tabler-trending-down class="text-6xl mb-8" />

**When Robinhood’s backend failed during a $1.1 trillion market surge**

<v-click>

*"Millions of traders were locked out on one of the biggest trading days in history — all due to a backend integration failure."*

</v-click>

<div class="absolute inset-0 bg-red-500/25 animate-pulse"></div>

<!-- speaker:
“This one hurts a little more personally…”
In March 2020, Robinhood’s trading API dependencies and load balancers failed right as markets rallied after a historic drop — during what analysts called a $1.1 trillion recovery day.
Developers later cited a chain of overloaded services and integration points that weren’t ready for the surge.
Transition: “Different industry, same story — fragile glue holding everything together.”

"Let's talk about why this isn't just TSB's problem or Robinhood's problem. This is YOUR problem. This is everyone's problem."
"Developers: You've written this adapter code 47 times. You know the drill. Read the docs, map the fields, handle the edge cases, write the tests, maintain it forever."
"And the scale is insane: the average company now integrates with 254 different APIs. That's not a typo. Two hundred and fifty-four."
"Business owners: Each integration takes 3 weeks minimum. Often longer. And the annual cost of integration failures globally? $600 billion. That's more than the GDP of Sweden."
"Customers and ops teams: 'Why is Slack behind email?' Because there are 6 API hops between the event and the notification. And when things break? 3 AM. The wakeup call no one wants."
Pause: "The integration tax is real."
"30% of your engineering time. $200K per engineer per year. 23% customer churn. 6 months to add a major integration."
"The hidden cost? Every hour spent writing adapters is an hour NOT building your actual product. The thing that differentiates you. The thing customers pay you for."
Tone: Make this visceral and personal. This should hurt a little.

"And within your organization? This works great. Your microservices all speak Protobuf? Amazing. Your team uses OpenAPI for all internal APIs? Chef's kiss."
Click to reveal: "But here's why it fails in the real world."
"Requires universal buy-in. You need Salesforce to adopt your standard. And Stripe. And Slack. And the 251 other APIs you integrate with."
"Salesforce's response? 'We have our own standard, thanks.' And they're not wrong—they have millions of customers. Why would they change for you?"
"Version migration nightmares. Remember Protobuf 2 to 3? Broke half the internet. Now imagine coordinating that migration across 254 different API providers who all upgrade on different schedules."
"And it doesn't solve the last-mile problem. Even if YOU use Protobuf internally, you still need adapters at every external boundary. You just moved the problem."
Quote the xkcd: "Standards are great! That's why we have 14 of them."

Click: "But here's why it falls short for integration problems."
"You just moved the adapter code. Every backend API still needs a resolver. And what does that resolver do? Maps fields. Handles errors. Transforms data. Congratulations, you wrote an adapter. You just called it a 'resolver.'"
"It doesn't handle webhooks, retries, or durability. GraphQL is request/response. What happens when Slack sends you a webhook? Or when an API call needs to retry for 6 hours? GraphQL doesn't solve that."
"Performance overhead. Query parsing, resolution logic, N+1 problems. This flexibility costs CPU. At scale, it costs money."
"And the real killer: it's great for YOUR APIs, but useless for THEIR APIs. Stripe isn't going to expose a GraphQL endpoint just because you asked nicely."

"So what ARE we actually solving? Let me be crystal clear about scope."
"In scope: Multi-protocol translation—REST, SOAP, GraphQL, webhooks, all of them. Schema mapping with field-level control—you control exactly how fields are transformed. Durable workflows that can retry for hours or days without losing state—the workflow sleeps, not burns CPU. Multi-tenant customer adapters that are isolated and scalable—each customer gets their own sandbox. And AI-assisted generation—from API docs to working code in seconds."
